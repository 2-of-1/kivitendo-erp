Description: Extended double entry accounting system for the german market.
 Lx-Office is derived from sql-ledger and rewritten
 and extended to meet german requirements in ERP software.
 It is multi user capable and the administrator can grant and revoke
 rights to access different modules. You can manage vendors and customers
 as well as goods and attendences. Invoices and orders as well as other
 documents can be sent direcly by email. German taxes are sent to Finanzamt
 via Winston and taxbird (Elster) out of the program. The data stored in
 datasets can
 be accessed by a group of users and it is possible to sent it in DATEV
 data format to a tax consultant. Most of the documents are printable in
 html or pdf format.
