Testsuite for Lx-Office.

These tests are a means to ensure basic sanity among the lx-office source
files. The test framework was originally written by the guys of Bugzilla, and
has been modified to cope with the Lx-Office structure.


The Tests:

001compile.t:  Tries to compile every source file. Bails out if any errors occur.
002goodperl.t: Checks every perl source file for taint, warnings and strict.
               While taint is not seen mandatory, warnings and strict are.
003safesys:    Checks is system() and exec() calls are fully qualified.
004template.t  defunct!
005no_tabs.t   checks every file for the \t Tab char. don't use tabs please.
006spelling.t  checks for common spelling errors.
011pog.t       checks if POD syntax is correct.


Wanted Tests:

- module check
- check if symlinks are missing.
- check for anything outside lower ascii in pl/pm files (only place for complex
  coding is locale)
- Devise a test to check if there are modifications to locales without a
  locales.pl run.
- Test if parse_template can compile all html templates.
- spec tests for pure backend modules like Form.pm and Common.pm
