This folder contais the frontend testscrips for Lx.
The Lx frontend are all perl scripts under bin/* .
The frontend tests don't need selenium! They should 
use the commandline API of Lx. Frontend tests in this 
directory are only for testing local Lx installations.

If you like to test the HTML screens in different 
Browsers, it would be better to use the selenium 
environment under t/selenium.
