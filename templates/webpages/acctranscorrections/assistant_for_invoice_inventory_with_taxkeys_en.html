 <p>
  There is at least one sales or purchase invoice for which Lx-Office recorded an inventory transaction with taxkeys even though no tax was recorded.
 </p>

 <p>
  Lx-Office can fix these problems automatically.

  It will simply set the taxkey to 0 (meaning "no taxes") which is the correct value for such inventory transactions.
