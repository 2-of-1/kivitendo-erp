   Lx-Office has been switched to group-based access restrictions.

   You have to create at least one group, grant it access to Lx-Office's functions and assign users to it.

   Otherwise all users will only have access to their own settings.

  </p>

  <p>

   During this user migration Lx-Office can create such a group for you and grant all users access to all of Lx-Office's functions.

   This corresponds to Lx-Office's behavior prior to version 2.4.4.

  </p>

  <p>

   Alternatively you can skip this step and create groups yourself.

  </p>

  <p>

   Do you want Lx-Office to create a group for access to all functions?

   This group will be called &quot;Full Access&quot;.
